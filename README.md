Project Title: Asteroid Escape - A Frontend Game
Introduction
Asteroid Escape is a small, engaging front-end game inspired by the classic Asteroid game. The player navigates through space, dodging asteroids to survive. The game is crafted using modern web technologies and elegantly styled with Tailwind CSS to provide a smooth and visually appealing gaming experience.

Technologies Used
JavaScript: The game logic and interactivity are implemented in JavaScript, housed in the index.js file.
HTML: The game's structure and content are defined in the index.html file.
Tailwind CSS: Utilized for styling the game interface, ensuring a responsive and aesthetically pleasing design.
File Structure
index.js: Contains the core game logic and event handling.
index.html: Defines the game's structure and loads necessary resources.
Implementation
The game's implementation is kept concise yet functional. index.js encapsulates the game logic, including player and asteroid movement, collision detection, and scoring. index.html lays out the game's structure and incorporates Tailwind CSS for styling, which significantly enhances the game's visual appeal without bloating the codebase.

Usage
Ensure you have a modern web browser.
Open index.html in your browser to launch the game.
Navigate through space, shoot asteroids, and aim for a high score!
